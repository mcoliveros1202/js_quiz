# js_quiz
## This quiz is designed as a short quiz to test one's knowledge on basic javascript. It begins with the option to start the quiz or go to the high scores page. There are five questions to answer, each with four choices, all to be completed within 60 seconds. An incorrect answer deducts 15 seconds from the timer. The quiz is over when all five questions have been answered or when time runs out. On the results page, the user is presented with their score, taken from the amount of time they have left, and are prompted to input their initials for display on the high scores page. They have the option to submit their initials or to try the quiz again. Once submitted, their score and initials are displayed on the screen if they are within the top five scores for the quiz.
